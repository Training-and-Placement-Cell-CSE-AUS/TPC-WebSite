# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

First, please take a moment to review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)
#### [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests)


## Reporting Issues
* If you have any bugs to report, features to request for, make sure the issue or feature request is not already posted by doing a [search](https://github.com/Training-and-Placement-Cell-CSE-AUS/TPC-WebSite/issues?q=).
  * If already created by someone else, put a comment there. This will let us know that more people are experiencing the problem or need.
  * If not, go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/Training-and-Placement-Cell-CSE-AUS/TPC-WebSite/issues/new).
* In case you found a **vulnerability or security threat**, **do not post an issue** as it will publically reveal the vulnerability. Instead, read our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) to know what to do.

## Submitting Pull Requests

### Getting started

You should be familiar with the basics of
[contributing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and have a fork
[properly set up](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Contribution-Technical-Practices).

You MUST always create PRs with _a dedicated branch_ based on the latest upstream tree.

If you create your own PR, please make sure you do it right. Also be so kind as to reference
any issue that would be solved in the PR description body,
[for instance](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
_"Fixes #XXXX"_ for issue number XXXX.

* **Important:** For this repository, make pull requests to the [main](https://github.com/Training-and-Placement-Cell-CSE-AUS/TPC-WebSite/tree/main) branch only. Pull requests to any other branches will be ignored or automatically closed.
* Before making a Pull Request, please search for any simillar pending/merged/rejected pull requests.
  * If a simillar pull request is merged, you can already use the solution from there.
  * If a simillar pull request is pending, you can comment if you think it would work or not or you can collaborate with the author to improve the solution.
  * If a simillar pull request is rejected, please refer to it for information.
